# CPP Module 06 - Different Types of Casting

## Overview
This module focuses on the different types of casting in C++, including static, dynamic, and reinterpret casting. 
## Key Topics
- **Static Cast**: Converting between related types at compile time (narrowing conversion might be problematic from double to int).
- **Dynamic Cast**: Safely downcasting and using runtime type information (RTTI).
- **Reinterpret Cast**: Reinterpreting the bit pattern of data as a different type.

## Notes
- - There is also a **Const Cast**: Removing or adding `const` qualifiers to objects.
